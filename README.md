# discrete-time-state-space-systems
This repository contains data(state space systems) generated by discretizing systems of ODEs. It also contains Galerkin approximation of PDEs which further generate systems of ODEs. Systems included are Burgers equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Lorenz equation, down pendulum, reversed Van der Pol oscillator and connected springs.
