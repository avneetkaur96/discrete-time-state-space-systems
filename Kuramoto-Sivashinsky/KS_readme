This folder contains the data generation code for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.
Galerkin approximation is used to convert KS partial differential equation into a system of ordinary differential equations. 
Forward Euler method is used to discretize the system of ODEs. 
Please run KS_data.ipynb to generate data
Since the data file is large, Github won't let me upload it.
