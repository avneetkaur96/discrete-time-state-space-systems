This folder contains the data generation code for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.
Galerkin approximation is used to convert KS partial differential equation into a system of ordinary differential equations. 
Forward Euler method is used to discretize the system of ODEs. 
Please run KS_data.ipynb to generate data
Since the data file is large, Github won't let me upload it.
The data will then be saved in 2 files: ks_data.npz and ks_data_diff_ic.ipynb
The first file will be split in the ratio of 8:1:1 for training, validation and testing. 
The second file will be used only to test if the neural network works well on data never seen before. The initial conditions for these sequences were sampled with a mean sampled from a wider range than the one used for training. 
To load data use the np.load() command.
