The code is in lorenz_data.ipynb
The data is in 2 files: lorenz_data.npz and lorenz_data_diff_ic.ipynb
The first file will be split in the ratio of 8:1:1 for training, validation and testing. 
The second file will be used only to test if the neural network works well on data never seen before. The initial conditions for these sequences were sampled with a mean sampled from a wider range than the one used for training. 
Feel free to geenrate new files and new data using the code. 
To load data use the np.load() command.
